Bogota

-Eat-
Andres tonight? That's the question on the tongue of every Bogota local and in-the-know visitor. Located in Chia, a 45-minute car ride from central Bogota, Andres Carne de Res is a sprawling 2.76 square mile restaurant that encompasses 11 dining areas, two dance floors, more than five kitchens, and a climbing wall. It draws hundreds, if not thousands, of people a night.

-Do-
* Visiting the Cerro de Monserrate, a white church perched atop one of Bogotá's surrounding mountains, is a rite of passage for any visitor (and plenty of local residents). Many people choose to walk up the (many, many) steps to the summit on weekend mornings, when the path is crowded with sporty pilgrims. Whether you walk or elect to take the terrifying funicular or slightly-less-terrifying cable car, the amazing panoramic view of the city is well worth the effort.
* Macarena district, Bogotá - The Macarena district is the center of the city’s art scene. La Peluquería not only offers edgy haircuts but also exhibits contemporary paintings. At the Alonso Garcés Galería (pictured), installations and photographs decorate a former church. After your art hop, pair tri-tip carpaccio with rioja at the restaurant Donostia.

Pacific Coast

-Sleep-
* El Cantil Ecolodge - After spending some amazing times in Bogota, Medellin, and literally everywhere in between as we made the drive through the countryside, we flew to the jewel of the trip, Nuqui on the Pacific coast. After circling in on the small prop plane between the mountains and ocean we were picked up on a boat and taken down the coast. We spent an amazing week in this casita without electricity, next to the waterfalls, migrating humpbacks, surf, and little else. http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g809122-d953932-Reviews-El_Cantil_Ecolodge-Nuqui_Choco_Department.html
