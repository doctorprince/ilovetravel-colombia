====================

The Goal: The goal of this project is to share my own itinerary suggestions for and upcoming trip to Colombia and secondly, to crowdsource ideas from others who've been there. 

The Trip Overview: Two weeks in Colombia from approx 1st to 14th January, 2015. Still deciding on an itinerary but we are looking at something like Bogota-Cartagena-. I'm still hoping to extend the trip a few more days to visit either the Amazon via Leticia or Medellin. 

About DoctorPrince: I'm a passionate about travel and organizing unique experince in my own city, San Francisco or outside. As soon as I have a destination in mind, I'll spend hours trolling multiple sites looking for the most unusual and iconic experiences. I burn hours this way. I have years of itineraries from trips past. It seems a shame to keep them locked up in a lone folder so my mission going forward is to ressurect them and publish them on Git so they can keep living. Hopefully others can get ideas from them and they can continue to live on even though I might not be planning to visit that destination again for the moment.

Thanks for your participation!
